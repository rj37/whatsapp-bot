Cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming can help burn calories, while strength training with weights or bodyweight exercises helps build muscle, which boosts your metabolism. A balanced routine might include 3-4 days of cardio and 2-3 days of strength training each week. How often are you currently working out?",

It's also helpful to find a workout or activity you enjoy so that it feels less like a chore. If you're ever feeling discouraged, remember that every step forward, no matter how small, is progress.

Sometimes increasing the intensity or frequency of your workouts or making small changes to your diet can make a difference. Remember, progress isn't always about the number on the scale—measurements, how your clothes fit, and how you feel are also important indicators. Would you like some tips on how to break through a plateau?",
